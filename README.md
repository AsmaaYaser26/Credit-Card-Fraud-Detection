Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection on a credit card transactions dataset for detecting fraudulent transactions.

# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Introduction

This project is based on a credit card transactions dataset and aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning algorithms. Fraud detection is a crucial part of ensuring secure and reliable financial transactions.

## Data

The data used in this project is a credit card transactions dataset. Each transaction is labeled as 'fraudulent' or 'non-fraudulent' based on its details. The dataset includes features like the amount of the transaction, time of the transaction, and other features which are principal components obtained with PCA.

## Methodology

I the Random Forest machine learning algorithm for this classification task:

**Random Forest**: Random Forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.

## Results

The random forest model had an accuracy of 95%, a precision of 95%, and a recall of 95% for both classes.
